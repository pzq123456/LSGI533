1. [GPS.js](https://github.com/infusion/GPS.js/?tab=readme-ov-file) : GPS.js is an extensible parser for NMEA sentences, given by any common GPS receiver. The output is tried to be as high-level as possible to make it more useful than simply splitting the information. The aim is, that you don't have to understand NMEA, just plug in your receiver and you're ready to go.
