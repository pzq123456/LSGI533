### **1. Briefly describe the following concepts (select any Four from the given five).**

- **Geodetic Datum** : 大地基准是描述地球形状并为地理坐标提供参考的数学模型，例如WGS84。A geodetic datum is a mathematical model that describes the shape of the Earth and provides a reference frame for measuring positions on its surface. It includes a reference ellipsoid and an origin point, enabling consistent positioning. Common examples are WGS84 and NAD83.

- **DGPS (Differential GPS)** : 差分GPS通过地面参考站对误差进行修正，提高GPS定位精度。DGPS enhances standard GPS accuracy by using ground-based reference stations to correct satellite signal errors. These corrections account for atmospheric effects, satellite orbit errors, and other biases, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy.

- **Ambiguity Resolution** : 模糊度解算是确定GPS卫星与接收机之间整周载波数的过程，用于实现高精度定位。Ambiguity resolution refers to determining the correct integer number of carrier wave cycles between a GPS satellite and receiver. It is critical for achieving centimeter-level accuracy in applications like RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) positioning.

- **INS (Inertial Navigation System)** : 惯性导航系统通过加速度计和陀螺仪计算位置和速度，无需依赖外部信号。INS is a self-contained navigation system that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to calculate position, velocity, and orientation without external references. It is commonly used in aircraft, ships, and autonomous vehicles.

- Map Matching (地图匹配) : 地图匹配是一种将定位数据与数字地图对齐的技术，通过纠正误差并匹配到道路网络实现。A technique to align positioning data (e.g., GPS) with a digital map by correcting errors and snapping to road networks.


- Dead Reckoning System :
  - DR系统是一种推算导航系统，通过已知的初始位置、速度、方向和时间，利用传感器数据（如加速度计和陀螺仪），逐步推算当前位置。这种方法不依赖外部信号，但误差会随着时间累积，因此常与GPS等其他导航技术结合使用。
  - A Dead Reckoning (DR) system is a navigation method that calculates the current position based on a known initial position, speed, direction, and time. It uses sensor data, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, to estimate movement. DR operates independently of external signals but suffers from error accumulation over time, making it often used alongside GPS for improved accuracy.

### **2. Positioning Principle of GPS and Comparison with Galileo**

#### **Positioning Principle of GPS**
GPS determines a receiver's position by measuring the time delay of signals transmitted from at least four satellites. Each satellite broadcasts its position and a timestamp, allowing the receiver to compute:
- **Range** to each satellite.
- Receiver position through trilateration.

GPS employs the WGS84 geodetic datum and corrects errors such as ionospheric delay and clock drift through control and user segments.

#### **Comparison with Galileo**
| Feature          | GPS                       | Galileo                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ownership**     | USA                       | European Union            |
| **Accuracy**      | Standard: 5-10 m         | Higher: <1 m (open)       |
| **Services**      | Basic (civil), military  | Open, commercial, public |
| **Frequency**     | Dual-frequency (L1, L2)  | Multi-frequency (E1, E5) |
| **Independence**  | US-controlled            | Independent EU operation |

### **3. WADGPS and WAAS**

#### **Working Principle of WADGPS**
Wide Area Differential GPS (WADGPS) uses a network of reference stations to monitor GPS signals across a region. These stations calculate error corrections, which are transmitted to users in real-time via geostationary satellites. WADGPS enhances positioning accuracy over large areas.

#### **WAAS Ionospheric Corrections**
The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) provides ionospheric corrections by:
1. Continuously monitoring the ionospheric delay at reference stations.
2. Generating a grid of correction values based on spatial models.
3. Broadcasting these corrections to users via geostationary satellites. Single-frequency users apply the corrections to improve accuracy.

### **4. Positioning with TDOA in Mobile Networks**

#### **TDOA Principle**
Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) determines position by measuring the relative time delays of signals received from multiple base stations. The method forms hyperbolic curves where the differences intersect, giving the location of the mobile device.

#### **Factors Affecting Accuracy**
1. **Signal Propagation Delay:** Variability due to environmental factors.
2. **Synchronization Errors:** Timing inaccuracies between base stations.
3. **Multipath Effects:** Signal reflections causing distorted measurements.
4. **Base Station Geometry:** Poor geometry degrades accuracy (GDOP).

### **5. DR System Errors and Calculation**

#### **a) Major Errors and Improvements**
- **Errors:**
  1. Sensor drift (e.g., gyroscope bias).
  2. Accumulated errors from odometers and accelerometers.
  3. Environmental factors, like wheel slip or terrain variability.

- **Improvements:**
  1. Sensor fusion with GNSS or map-matching techniques.
  2. Calibration and periodic error corrections.
  3. Use of high-quality sensors and advanced algorithms.

#### **b) Position Calculation**
**Given:**
- Start: \( E_0 = 56000 \, \mathrm{m}, N_0 = 49000 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- Initial bearing: \( 135^\circ \)
- Angle change rate: \( 5^\circ / \mathrm{s} \)
- Speed: \( 8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \)
- Time: \( 5 \, \mathrm{s} \)

1. Final bearing: \( 135^\circ + 5^\circ \times 5 = 160^\circ \).
2. Distance traveled: \( 8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \times 5 = 40 \, \mathrm{m} \).
3. Convert to coordinates:
   \[
   \Delta E = 40 \cos(160^\circ), \quad \Delta N = 40 \sin(160^\circ).
   \]
   Using trigonometry, the final coordinates are:
   \[
   E = 56000 + \Delta E, \quad N = 49000 + \Delta N.
   \]

### **6. Warehouse Staff Tracking System**

#### **Principles of Positioning**
For 5 m accuracy, options include:
- **UWB (Ultra-Wideband):** Measures signal time-of-flight for high accuracy.
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy):** Measures signal strength (RSSI).
- **RFID:** Uses proximity sensors for tracking.

#### **System Design**
- **Transmitters:** UWB beacons or BLE tags attached to staff.
- **Receivers:** Fixed stations within the warehouse.
- **Data Processing:** Central system calculates positions in real time.

#### **Achievable Accuracy**
- UWB: 10-30 cm.
- BLE: ~5 m with dense beacon placement.

#### **Limitations**
1. **Signal Obstruction:** Metal shelving or equipment causing interference.
2. **Deployment Cost:** High initial cost for infrastructure.
3. **Scalability:** Increased complexity with more staff or larger areas.
