1. Positioning Accuracy 

    | Type | Accuracy | Example |
    |------|----------|---------|
    | Space-based | 1 cm (surveying) 1 m -10 m (Nav) | GNSS |
    | Ground-based | 200 m | Loran-C |
    | Celestial | a few nmi (nautical miles) | Stars |

2. Positioning Methods
   - Landmarking
     - Visual:Nature land shapes,Buildings,Images,Lighthouse
     - Non-visual: Beacons,Terrain Matching,Signal Matching (“Fingerprint”)
   - Celestial Positioning
   - Intersection with distance and angle

3. Modern Positioning Systems 
| Gyro Compass (magnetic compass) | Inertial navigation systems (INS) | Radar | Terrestrial radio navigation systems | Satellite navigation systems | Charts and maps | Sonar systems | Doppler Systems | Images | Smartphone | Wireless Sensor networks |

4. Navigation
Navigation is a process of monitoring and controlling the movement of an object from one place to another.
