| **Type**          | **Accuracy**            | **Example**          |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Space-based        | 1 cm (surveying), 1-10 m (navigation) | GNSS               |
| Ground-based       | ~200 m                 | Loran-C              |
| Celestial          | A few nautical miles (nmi) | Stars               |

**2. Positioning Methods**
- **Landmarking**:
  - **Visual**: Natural landforms, buildings, images, lighthouses.
  - **Non-visual**: Beacons, terrain matching, signal matching (e.g., "fingerprinting").
- **Celestial Positioning**: Using celestial objects like stars for navigation.
- **Intersection with Distance and Angle**: Triangulation or trilateration.

**3. Modern Positioning Systems**
Modern systems include:  
Gyro Compass, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), Radar, Terrestrial Radio Navigation Systems, Satellite Navigation Systems, Charts and Maps, Sonar Systems, Doppler Systems, Images, Smartphones, and Wireless Sensor Networks.

**4. Navigation**
Navigation is the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of an object from one location to another.

**5. Kinematic Positioning**
Kinematic positioning involves determining the state of a moving object, including:  
- **Time**
- **Position (3D)**: Latitude, longitude, and height.
- **Orientation (3D)**: Roll, pitch, and heading.
- **Velocity (6D)**: Linear and angular velocities.
- **Acceleration (6D)**: Linear and angular accelerations.

**6. Navigation System Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Degree of conformance between estimated and true parameters.
  - Predictable, repeatable, and relative accuracy.
- **Availability**: Percentage of time the system is usable.
- **Integrity**: System’s ability to provide timely warnings when errors occur.
- **Reliability**: Probability of functioning without failure under specific conditions.
- **Continuity**: Ability to perform uninterrupted operations.
- **Redundancy**: Adds reliability by repeating or adding measurements. Never rely on a single system.
- **Resilience**: Tolerates errors, detects failures, and recovers using alternative systems.
- **Integration**: Combines multiple systems to enhance performance and add new functionalities (e.g., navigation + communication).

**7. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)**
VLBI uses signals from pulsars or quasars (very weak signals). Two stations measure signal delay differences, enabling distance measurements with millimeter-level accuracy over thousands of kilometers.

**8. Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR)**
- Transmits laser pulses to satellites, which reflect them back to Earth.
- Measures the travel time to calculate distance.
- Applications include orbit determination, station positioning, and gravity studies.

**9. Satellite Altimetry**
- Uses radar to measure the distance from satellites to Earth.
- Applications include ocean circulation and direct geoid measurements.

**10. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**
- Converts scanned distances into images.

- Weather-independent performance.

**11. GPS System**
- **Components**:
  - **Space Segment**: Satellites in orbit.
  - **User Segment**: Receivers.
  - **Control Segment**: Monitoring stations.
- **Accuracy**: Ranges from 1 mm to 10 m, depending on receiver type, dynamics, and processing techniques.
- **Positioning Services**:
  - **PPS**: Precise Positioning Service.
  - **SPS**: Standard Positioning Service.

| **Technical Issues**       | **Solution**                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Control segment vulnerability | Atomic clocks                  |

**13. Pseudo-range Positioning**
- **SPS (Standard Positioning Service)**: C/A (Coarse/Acquisition) code, ~10 m accuracy.
- **PPS (Precise Positioning Service)**: P/Y (Precision) code, ~1 m accuracy.

**14. Differential GPS (DGPS)**
- Uses a receiver at a known location to measure errors in pseudo-ranges.
- Real-time corrections are transmitted to mobile users.
- Post-processing: Single/double difference removes ephemeris, atmospheric, and clock errors.

**15. GPS Carrier Phase**
- Primary method for high-precision surveying.
- Measures phase differences in carrier signals (L1/L2).
- Wavelength: ~19-24 cm, with resolution in millimeters.
- Requires integer ambiguity resolution, static/kinematic processing.

**16. PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing)**
The GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) serves as the backbone for PNT infrastructure.

**17. GNSS Vulnerabilities**
- **System Failures**: Malfunctioning hardware or wrong messages/signals.
- **Unintentional Interference**: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), ionospheric disturbances, spectrum congestion.
- **Intentional Interference**: Jamming, spoofing (fake signals).
- **Human Factors**: Equipment design errors, user errors, and over-reliance on GNSS.
