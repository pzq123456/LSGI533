## 1. Resilient PNT Services
- Ability to tolerate partial failures
    – Detect failures (Integrity) : Time to alarm
    – Isolation and Alternative Systems : Tolerant Performance
    – Recovery from failures : Fast recovery

GNSS Vulnerabilities
• System failure
    – Wrong message
    – Wrong signals
• Unintentional Interference
    – Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
    – Ionosphere; Solar Max
    – Spectrum Congestion
• Intentional Interference
    – Jamming
    – Spoofing – Counterfeit Signals
• Human Factors
    – User Equipment & GPS SV Design Errors
    – Lack of Knowledge/Training
    – Over-Reliance on GNSS

## 2. Marine Navigation
- Navigation = Positioning + Route + Guidance Navigation is a real-time feedback process

- Mainly used for Marine Navigation
    – Radio Navigation Systems
    – Radar and AIS
    – Nav-aids Lighthouse
    – Charts

3. Automatic Identification Systems (AIS)


- A device to broadcast : where am I ,who am I ,what am I doing. get same information from surrounding ships. Enhance Marine Safety. Provide More Efficient Navigation. 
- components : Cellular Broadcast using VHF, Synchronization Mechanism, Organization of Transmissions
- Self Organized TDMA : 2250 Slots per minutes, each slot 26.67 ms - 256 bits of data (enough for a position report)
- Messages: Static Data ,Dynamic Data ,Voyage Related Data ,Short Safety Related Message
- Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) : ECDIS is a integrated navigation system, NOT 
## 3. Air Navigation
1. Air Corridor : An air corridor refers to a designated route in the sky that aircraft follow to ensure safe and efficient travel between two points. It serves as a virtual highway in the airspace, guiding airplanes along a predetermined path to minimize congestion and maximize navigational accuracy. 
2. Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a radio navigation system that provides precision guidance to aircraft approaching a runway.
- There are several components that make up an ILS system:
    – Localizer for horizontal guidance
    – Glideslope for vertical guidance
    – Approach lights (optional)
    – Marker beacons (optional)
