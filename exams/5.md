# 5. Navigation with GNSS 

1. Satellite is moving, and Satellite signals will have Doppler effects (the transmitted frequency will be different from the received frequency). Why do we use the same wavelength when we process carrier phase measurements ?
- In carrier phase measurements, a fixed nominal wavelength is used despite Doppler effects because the method focuses on relative phase changes, not absolute frequency. Doppler effects are modeled separately, and using a constant wavelength simplifies processing while maintaining high precision.

## 2. Local Differential GPS (DGPS) 

Local DGPS is a positioning method that relies on one reference station and is typically effective within a range of **a few hundred kilometers**. It operates under the assumption that both the reference station and the users experience similar error sources, such as atmospheric and orbital errors. 

Key features of Local DGPS:  
- **Reference Station Role**: The reference station generates the **total error** for each satellite signal it receives.  
- **User Corrections**: Users apply these corrections, known as **range corrections**, to their own measurements to improve positioning accuracy.

- problems with Local DGPS:

  1. Spatial De-correlation  
     - Occurs when the distance between the reference station and the user increases.  
     - Errors such as orbital inaccuracies and atmospheric delays (ionospheric and tropospheric) become less correlated, reducing the effectiveness of the corrections.

  2. Temporal De-correlation  
     - Happens when range corrections are delayed in reaching the user.  
     - The dynamic nature of error sources, such as atmospheric conditions, means outdated corrections can lead to inaccuracies.

## 3. Wide Area Differential GPS (WADGPS)

WADGPS expands upon the concept of DGPS by utilizing multiple reference stations spread over a wide area. It provides more comprehensive corrections by breaking down the total error into distinct components, including:  
- **Orbit Errors**  
- **Ionospheric Delays**  
- **Tropospheric Delays**  
- **Satellite Clock Errors** (further divided into slow and fast corrections)

1. **Correction Transmission**  
   - Corrections are broadcast to users via geostationary satellites.  

2. **Wide Coverage**  
   - Since the same set of corrections is distributed over a large region, WADGPS is effective across much wider areas compared to local DGPS.

3. **Error Component Application**  
   - Users apply the corrections for each error component separately, improving accuracy and adaptability for various locations and conditions.

## 4. Signal Propagation Corrections in WADGPS

1. **Tropospheric Delay**  
   - Corrected by the reference stations (monitors).  
   - These corrections are **not transmitted** to users.  
   - Instead, users apply tropospheric delay models based on **local atmospheric conditions**.

2. **Ionospheric Delay**  
   - Corrected using data from multiple reference stations, covering a large area.  
   - Handled through:  
     - **Dual-frequency measurements** to directly estimate the delay.  
     - **Single-frequency measurements** combined with ionospheric delay models.  
   - These corrections are often fitted using **models or grid points**, with grid-based corrections estimated at regular intervals (e.g., 5°x5° grids).


### Ionosphere Grid Model  

- Uses data from a large network of reference stations to estimate ionospheric delay at grid points.  
- Provides regional corrections, offering better accuracy over large areas.

### Satellite Clock Corrections  

1. **Slow Corrections**  
   - Correct **long-term effects**, primarily due to satellite atomic clock errors.  
   - Modeled using polynomials to account for clock drift.

2. **Fast Corrections**  
   - Broadcast every few seconds.  
   - Address **remaining short-term errors**, ensuring high accuracy in real-time positioning.

### Correction Transmission  

- **Geostationary Satellites**:  
  - Distribute corrections over wide areas.  
  - Signals have a structure similar to GPS, including frequency, data format, and PRN codes.  
  - Ensures compatibility with existing GPS receivers, requiring minimal changes.  

- **Extra Range Measurements**:  
  - Include corrections for propagation delays and satellite errors to enhance accuracy.

### Example: OmniSTAR, Landstar

OmniSTAR is a service provided by the Dutch multinational company **Fugro**. It offers various levels of commercial differential GPS (DGPS) services, including:  

- **Local DGPS (LDGPS)**: Provides accuracy within a few meters.  
- **Wide Area DGPS (WADGPS)**: Offers sub-meter accuracy for higher precision applications.  

#### Key Features of OmniSTAR:  
- Requires a **decoder** to access correction signals.  
- Utilizes **geostationary satellites** as a data link to transmit corrections over a wide area, ensuring broad coverage.
