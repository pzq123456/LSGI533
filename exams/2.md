# GPS Receiver and Observables
1. Signal Form
   - L1: P code, C/A code, and Nav. Message, 1575.42 MHz (wavelength: 19 cm)
   - L2: P code, Nav. Message, 1227.60 MHz (wavelength: 24 cm)
   - PRN (Pseudo-Random Noise) Codes : Binary sequences with noise-like properties
   - P code: 10.23 MHz (30m), 266 days long, cut into 7-day long segments to each satellite – each satellite assigned a PRN number
   - C/A (coarse/acquisition) Code: 1.023 MHz (300m) (1 ms long)
   - Navigation Message (50 bit/s) : information about the system and ephemeris

2. Phase Modulation (PM) / 相位调制 : Phase modulation is a technique where the phase of a carrier signal is varied according to the instantaneous value of the information signal. For instance, the carrier’s phase may shift by 180° at each data transition.相位调制是一种通过根据信息信号的瞬时值改变载波信号相位的调制技术。例如，在数据跳变时载波相位可能发生180°的偏移。
3. Pseudo-Random Noise Code
    - Generated using Feedback Shift Register (FBSR)
    - Spectrum similar to noise
    - Good Correlation Property
    - Each satellite has different codes
    - Used mainly for Identification (CDMA) \range measurement
    - Correlation Property of PRN codes : Codes from two satellites are not correlated. All he P codes From different satellites are not corrected, although they come from one PRN series.
