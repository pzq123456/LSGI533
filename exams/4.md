# Positioning with GNSS
## Pseudorange Errors
- related to Satellite(Ephemeris, Clock, Orbit)
  - Model: 
  - $$ dt^s = a_0 + a_1 (t - t_0) + a_2 (t - t_0)^2 $$
- related to Receiver(Measurement Noise, Clock, Multipath)
- related to Propagation 
  - Troposphere delay(modeling and correction)
    - Model: the hopefield model, the saastamoinen model
  - Ionoshpere delay(modeling and correction, Ionosphere-free observations)
    - Model: Klobuchar Model Single Frequency 
    - Ionosphere free combination dual frequency P = 2.564P(L1) - 1.564P(L2)
- Observation Equations
    -   | code | equation |
        | -- | -- |
        | L | [dp^1 ... dp^n] |
        | n | [n^1 ... n^n] |
        | A | [a_1 a_2 a_3 c] * n rows |
        | x | [dx dy dz dtr]
    - Least Square Solution 
    - $$ x = (A^T W A) ^{-1} A^T W L$$
    - Covariance Matrix
    - $$ \sum(x) =(A^T W A)^-1 \sigma_0^2$$
    - $\sigma_0$ is pseudorange measuremet errors
    - $(A^T W A)^-1$ is the geometric factor dependent on positions of satellites and receivers
    - W is the weight metrix. unique weight for all satellites. based on elevation angle, signal noise ratio, residuals
    - How to improve position precision? 1. We can reduce the $\sigma_0$ by reducing system random errors. 2. We can have more proper statistic model or wight(W) to reflect the real property of measurements.
- DOP Dilution of Precision : The effects of satellite geomatric distribution on the accuracy of navigation solution. Used to measure the geomatric strength of positioning. Transform from XYZ to local NEH
