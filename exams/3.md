# GPS Measurement Errors and Corrections
1. International GNSS Services (IGS)
2. For single-frequency receivers, ionospheric delay is mitigated using models due to the complexity of the ionosphere's physical processes. Commonly used models include:
   - IRI Model: Provides an electron density profile.提供电子密度剖面。
   - Bent Model: A detailed model with over 1,000 coefficients.一个包含超过 1000 个系数的详细模型。
   - Klobuchar Model: A simplified model widely adopted by GPS systems.GPS系统广泛采用的简化模型。
3. Ionospheric scintillation refers to signal interference caused by disturbances in the ionosphere. These disturbances are often triggered by solar activity or geomagnetic fields, leading to:
   - Amplitude variations: Fluctuations in signal strength.
   - Phase variations: Changes in signal phase.
   电离层闪烁是指由电离层扰动引起的信号干扰。这些扰动通常由太阳活动或地磁场引发，导致以下现象：
   - 振幅变化：信号强度的波动。
   - 相位变化：信号相位的变化。

4. Tropospheric delay
- The Zenith Total Delay (ZTD), estimated using data from ground-based GPS receivers, is highly sensitive to atmospheric properties, especially the water vapor content in the air, which is the most dynamic parameter in the atmosphere and crucial for meteorological studies.天顶总延迟（ZTD）可以通过地基GPS接收机的数据估算得出，对大气特性高度敏感，尤其是大气中最具动态变化的参数——水汽含量，这对气象研究至关重要。
